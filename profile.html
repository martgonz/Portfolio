            <p>I've lived in several towns and cities in the West. I came to Seattle
              as a temporary resident with intentions of staying for seven months. Two years later
              I'm still here.  I decided to attend the evening class with Epicodus because I wanted
              to find my creativity again. I feel that over the years of maintaining certain jobs
              I've lost the opportunity to be creative and I'm struggling to find that intrinsic
              reward. <strong>I needed an intervention in my life.</strong>  <br>I decided to expand my knowledge and
              learn to code mostly for the challenge and the opportunity to regain the creative person
              I used to be.  I know life is very short and it gains speed every year, I do not want to look back and say <em>"I wish I would have"</em> my biggest
              fear is holding my self back, to live paralyzed.  My philosophy is to try something new on a regular basis because I might discover a new passion. <br>
              Regardless of where this course leads me I am very excited to take the initial step of exploring.  At this time I have to admit the class has been
              something I look forward to doing and I've enjoyed meeting my classmates.
